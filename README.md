# SPADE-pix2pix-for-Anime
This pix2pix model is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN, GANs). I implemented in order to generate from a segmentation label to an anime illust. I could not get a satisfactory result, but obtained enough for small and rough datasets.   
<br>

## Architecture  
- The original `SPADE` computes a weight from label at each itself layers, so this architecture has a mapping network like the StyleGAN and precompute weights. However, it is `Constant-Resolution FCN`, uses `AtrousConvolution`, instead of `FCN` in order not to do down sampling. In addition, each `SPADE` layer resize and share a encoded weight by a mapping network.  
- I want to assign a hair color, so this Generator has double mapping networks, inputed a segmented label to one mapping network and a RGB color map, to another. The RGB color map has a hair color and positions, it is same resolution with label.  
- I added `NoiseAdder` like StyleGAN.  
- I selected a single patch discriminator with `SelfAttention` instead of `Multi-scale discriminator`.  
- The discriminator's loss is `Hinge loss` and `Zero Centered Gradient Penalty`.  
- The generator's loss is `Hinge loss`, `Feature Matching loss` and `Perceptual loss`.

## Result  
<img src="https://github.com/pit-ray/SPADE-pix2pix-for-Anime/blob/master/tile.png?raw=true" width=512>  

This result is obtained by training with **500 pixiv images**.  That is very small datasets.  
Additionaly, test datasets is generated by <a href="https://github.com/pit-ray/Anime-Semantic-Segmentation-GAN">Anime-Semantic-Segmentation-GAN</a>, and training datasets is manualy anotated. However, I cannot publish training datasets for copyright of source images.  

The parameters of the upper result is almost same as default value of `options.py`.

## How to train
Please create `dataset` directory and prepare dataset. Next, you can set dataset path to option of command.<br>
<br>
```  
Python3 train.py --dataset_dir dataset/example
```  
<br>  

## Pretrained Weights  
Shold you want them, please send to me by Issues. Then I am going to re-train by my datasets and appear download URL, because pre-trained weights don't match refactored python-scripts.
